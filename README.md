# Single-cell Epi2-seq

This is the repository accompanying the single-cell Epi2-seq manuscript by Geisenberger et al. 2023. 


## Data avalability
Raw scEPI2-seq data have been deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus (accession xxx). Data for comparisons to K562 whole genome bisulfite sequencing data were downloaded from ENCODE ().


## Data Processing 

### Preprocessing 

Preprocessing of fastq.gz files was performed using the Package *SingleCellMultiOmics* developed by [Buys de Barbanson](https://github.com/BuysDB). The software package is available on [github](https://github.com/BuysDB/SingleCellMultiOmics)
